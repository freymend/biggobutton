# Big Go Button

Create an app that consits of nothing but a giant button filling the screen

## Details

- The entire screen should consist of a single push button, labled "Push Me!"
- The button should also have a green bacgkround, red text. The button text should be 40db in size and italicized
- When I push the "Push Me!" button, the text should change to read "You have pushed me 1 time!"
- Each time I push the "Push Me!" button, the counter in the text should increment by 1 and the text should read "You have push med 2 times!" "...3times!" and so on

## Goals

- Experiment with settings properties in resources
- Experiment with setting properties from code
- Experiment with adding an event handler
